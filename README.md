There is only one commit to the repo because my computer is the only one in our group that has a GPU. So, we had to run our model on said computer.



Abstract
-------------
We are planning to make a Machine Learning Algorithm for Facial Recognition, using PyTorch. We will get a large set of data to feed our NN, tweaking the hyperparameters until we get an optimal results for detecting human faces. We will be implementing this on embedded hardware such as a RaspberryPi and Jeston Nano.
